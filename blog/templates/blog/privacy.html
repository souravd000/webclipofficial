                        <h1 class="display-4"> We will here discuss our privacy policy in simple, clear, transparent and short.</h1>
                        <p>We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it,
                        and that you should have meaningful control over both. We want to empower you to make the
                        best decisions about the information that you share with us.</p>
                        <p>Webclip is public and Posts are viewable and searchable by anyone around the
                        world. We give you non-public ways to communicate on Webclip too, through protected Posts and
                        Chatclip Messages. You can also use Webclip under a pseudonym if you prefer not to use your name.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Basic Account Information</h4>
                        <p>We require certain information to provide our services to you. For example, you must have an account
                        in order to upload or share content on Webclip. When you choose to share the information below with us,
                        we collect and use it to operate our services.
                        </p>
                        <P>You have to make a Webclip account for interacting on posts ( like, Comment, Repost).
                        If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that
                        we can provide our services to you. On Webclip this includes a user name (for example, “WebclipOfficial1234”),
                        a display name (for example, "Webclip Official"), a password, and an email address. Your display name and username are always public.
                        You can also create and manage multiple Webclip accounts using the same email address. You can verify one of those accounts with profile verification.
                        </P>

                        <p>We don't share any of our user information outside Webclip excluding your posts. Your information is always
                        safe with us. We barely use third parties for our services.
                        </p>
                        <P>The lists you create, people you follow and who follow you, and Posts you Like or Repost are also public.
                        If you like, Repost, comment, reply to a post those are also public. Your post ( text-posts, photos, videos, audios)
                        are downloadable. Anyone can download your photos, videos, or audio, so watermarking is a useful tip always.</P>
                        <p>The information posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public. For example, other people
                        may tag you in a photo or mention you in a comment.</p>
                        <p>We will update our service to keep our and your privacy at best. While we are privacy-driven social media,
                        we don't take any of your data unless you decide to give us. You can choose either you want to let other users
                        comment or Repost your Posts or not. We don't take your location or IP address by our system functions.

                        </p>
                        <p>You are responsible for your posts and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully
                        about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Webclip, such
                        as by deleting a Post or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Webclip.
                        </p>
                        <p>By publicly posting content when you Post, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible.
                           When you are posting content, you are directing your post globally.
                        </p>
                        <P><strong> So What you give us?</strong>
                        While creating your account, you decide to give us your username, full name, Email id. After updating your profile, you give
                        us your Bio, your profile picture, your relationship status, your gender, and the things, which you will get visiting your profile update page.
                        By updating your profile, you can choose what will be in your profile publically.
                        </P>
                        <p>You can verify your profile for privacy. For that, you have to submit a form using google forms ( we use google drive for storing your Id photos until verification )
                         where you will submit the information that's required to verify your profile with any of your government authorized IDs. After Verifying your profile we permanently
                         delete your Government Authorized id card photos and other information that you share with us.
                        That's the way we keep our relationship with you stronger. You have to verify your profile for security issues and against fake Id. If you decide not to verify your
                        profile you can still use Our services. After verification of your profile, you will get a blue tick badge which will be viewed by the public.
                        </p>
                        <p>We have two types of badge a blue tick badge for profile verification and a popular crown badge for public figures or artists or users who have a broad range of followers.
                        You have to verify your profile first to apply for a popular crown badge.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our profile verification and popular badge verification is completely a human process which is why we take a couple of days to verify your profile.
                        After your verification, we will send you an email to notify you.</p>
